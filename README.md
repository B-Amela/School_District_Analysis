# School_District_Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to replace the inaccurate data at Thomas High School while keeping the rest of the data intact and perform the same analysis as in the module. The metrics that we want to analyze our data by include: total school budget, per student capita, average math and reading score, the passing percent for math and reading, and the overall passing percentage.

## Data
- Average Math Scores: moved from 79 to 78.9 (.1 point) as a result of this change.

- Average Reading Scores did not change

- Perent Passing Math moved from 75% to 74% (delta: 1 percentage point)

- Percent  Passing Reading moved from 86% to 85% (1 percentage point)

- Percent Overall Passing moved from 65% to 64% (1 percentage point)

## Summary
The four major changes that occurred is the number of total students, the number of students counted at Thomas High School, the average math and reading scores, and the overall percentages for math and reading at Thomas High School. The removal of data implies a decrease in the count of total students overall, and total students at Thomas High School, specifically for this analysis. As tge  population was decreased, this leads to a change in average scores and score percentages. Due to the fact that these score and percentage changes were minimal, we can assume that the removal of math and reading scores of 9th graders at Thomas High School not as significant as we would imagine it to be.
